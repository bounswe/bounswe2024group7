### **Lab Report**

#### **Summary of Discussions:**
1. **Search Functionality Enhancement:**
   - Implement semantic search for exercises and forum posts.
   - Include hashtags for better discoverability.
   - Focus on fuzzy and contextual query matching for improved user experience.
   - Use Elasticsearch or similar tools for indexing exercises and posts.

2. **Digital Ocean Migration:**
   - Transition from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to Digital Ocean for deployment.
   - Update CI/CD pipelines to align with the new infrastructure.

3. **Profile Page Enhancements:**
   - Add "Completed" and "In Progress" posts to user profiles for better engagement and tracking.

4. **Training Program Integration:**
   - Allow users to link training programs to posts, enhancing interactivity and value.

#### **Plan for Demo Next Week:**
1. **Data Population Strategy:**
   - Populate the database with 100 sample exercises covering various body parts, muscles, and equipment.
   - Add 50 sample posts, including hashtags and linked training programs.
   - Ensure diverse scenarios, such as:
     - Searching exercises with broad and specific terms.
     - Searching posts with hashtags related to fitness goals.

2. **Demo Scenarios:**
   - **Search Functionality:**
     - Demonstrate semantic search with examples like "glute stretches" or "fitness goals."
     - Show filtered results for exercises and forum posts.
   - **Profile Page:**
     - Showcase "Completed" and "In Progress" posts in a user profile.
   - **Training Program Integration:**
     - Demonstrate linking training programs to posts and their discoverability via search.

#### **Software Quality Plan:**
1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Cover 90% of search functionality, including:
     - Exercise search.
     - Forum post search with hashtag prioritization.
   - Validate database indexing and data retrieval accuracy.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test end-to-end search flow for exercises and posts.
   - Validate the migration of deployment to Digital Ocean and pipeline functionality.
   - Verify profile page updates with dynamic post statuses.

#### **User Experience Decisions (From Previous Lab):**
1. Simplified search bar design with autocomplete suggestions for hashtags and exercises.
2. "Completed" and "In Progress" posts made visually distinct for user clarity.
3. Integration of training programs in posts allows users to directly engage with structured workout plans.

#### **Milestone 2 Preparation:**
- **Team Tasks:**
  - **Search Functionality:** Finalize semantic search implementation and indexing strategy.
  - **Digital Ocean Migration:** Deploy the application to Digital Ocean and ensure the CI/CD pipeline is operational.
  - **Profile Page Enhancements:** Complete the "Completed" and "In Progress" post features.
  - **Training Program Integration:** Implement the linking of training programs to posts.

Individuals may work on specific aspects to ensure all items are completed by the milestone.
